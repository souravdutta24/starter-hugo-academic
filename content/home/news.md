**October 2022:** I have started my new position as Research Fellow at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences of The University of Texas at Austin. I will be working with [Clint Dawson](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Clint%20Dawson/) and some of his collaborators from the esteemed [Computational Hydraulics Group](https://chg.oden.utexas.edu/). Looking forward to an exciting and productive time ahead.

**September 2022:** Co-organizing a minisymposium on *Machine Learning and Data-Driven Methods for Forward and Inverse Problems* along with [Matthew Farthing](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/About/Leadership/Bio-Article-View/Article/3151369/dr-matthew-farthing/) and [Dhruv Patel](https://dhruvpatel108.github.io/) at the [SIAM Mathematics of Data Science 2022](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/mds22) meeting in San Diego, CA.

[Session 1](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=74814) [Session 2](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=74815)

**July 2022:** Giving a talk on *Physics-Aware Machine Learning Model for Predicting Coastal Hydrodynamics* at the [SIAM Annual Meeting 2022](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/an22) in Pittsburgh, PA.

**June 2022:** Giving a talk at the [Computational Methods in Water Resources 2022](https://cmwrconference.org/) (CMWR) meeting on *Deep Learning Methods for Reduced Order Modeling of Convection-Dominated Environmental Hydrodynamics*.

**May 2022:** Attending the [HydroML](https://iee.psu.edu/events/hydroml-symposium-big-data-machine-learning-hydrology-and-water-resources) Symposium on Big Data Machine Learning in Hydrology and Water Resources at Penn State University.

**February 2022:** Giving an invited talk on *Data-Driven Reduced Order Modeling for Applications in Computational Hydrology* in the Applied Math Seminar of the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.tamucc.edu/science/departments/math-and-statistics/) at Texas A&M University Corpus-Christi.
