abstract: In this article, the convergence of a hybrid numerical method introduced in Daripa & Dutta (2017) has been established. This method integrates a discontinuous finite element method with a modified method of characteristics (MMOC) in combination with finite difference (FD) procedures, and has been successfully applied to solve a coupled system of nonlinear equations that arises in multicomponent two-phase porous media flows. The present convergence analysis is focused on the MMOC-FD procedure for a nonlinear system of transport equations. For this purpose, an analogous single-component system of transport equations has been considered and some key ideas for possible extension to multicomponent systems have been briefly discussed. Error estimates have been obtained and these estimates have also been shown to be consistent with realistic numerical simulations of flows arising in enhanced oil recovery processes.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Convergence analysis is performed in 1D for a hybrid numerical method that combines a discontinuous finite element method with a finite difference method to solve tow-phase, two-component flow and transport in porous media.
